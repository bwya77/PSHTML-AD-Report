# PSHTML-AD-Report

While I walk you through the report, you can view it for yourself [here](https://thelazyadministrator.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/4-12-2018-ADReport.html)

Interactive HTML report generated with PowerShell to give you an overview of your Active Directory enviornment. 

Requires ReportHTML module but will attempt to install on first run. Requires ActiveDirectory module to be present.
